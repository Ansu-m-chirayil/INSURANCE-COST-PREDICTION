### Overview of the Project

# PROJECT: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION (INSURANCE-COST-PREDICTION)

### OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model that can predict the insurance charges for individuals based on their demographic and health-related factors. By analyzing and understanding the relationships between these features and the insurance charges, we aim to provide a reliable model that can aid in setting fair and accurate insurance premiums.

### LIBRARIES USED
1. **Pandas**: Provides data structures and functions for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Seaborn**: Offers a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
3. **Matplotlib**: Allows for the creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
4. **train_test_split**: Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
5. **LinearRegression**: Implements linear regression for predicting values based on linear relationships.
6. **mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score**: Metrics for evaluating the performance of regression models.
7. **NumPy**: Provides support for numerical operations on arrays and matrices.

### KEY INSIGHTS
**Findings**: The linear regression model's R-squared value indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.

**Interpretation:**
 A higher R-squared value implies a better fit for the model.

**Comparison:**
 Compare the performance of the model with other potential models (e.g., polynomial regression, ridge regression) in future work.
 
**Limitations:**
 Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and target variable, which may not always hold true.

**Conclusion**
The linear regression model provides a baseline for predicting insurance charges based on the given features.

**Future Work:**
Explore more advanced models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
